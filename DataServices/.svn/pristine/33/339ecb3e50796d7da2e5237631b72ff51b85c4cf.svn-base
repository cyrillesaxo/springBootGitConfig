= Vert.x Camel Bridge examples

Here you will find examples demonstrating Vert.x Camel Bridge in action.

The Vert.x Camel bridge provides a way to use Camel routes from the event bus. Please consult the Vert.x Camel Bridge
documentation for more information.

== Feed example

This example reads a RSS feeds, filter the entries, extract the title and send these titles (one by one) on the event
 bus.

This example demonstrates:

* routes that produces messages
* camel bridge configuration (outbound)
* SEDA support
* filter and transformations

**Source code:**

* link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/camel/feed/FeedExample[Feed Example]

Launch it by running the `main` method in your IDE or, after having build the project with `mvn clean package`, with:


----
java -jar target/camel-bridge-examples-3.3.2.jar run io.vertx.example.camel.feed.FeedExample
----

== RMI example

This example serves HTTP requests by invoking a Camel route that interacts with a RMI service.

This example demonstrates:

* routes that are use as _RPC_ support
* camel bridge configuration (inbound)
* XML-based definition of the `Camel Context`

**Source code:**

* link:src/main/java/io/vertx/example/camel/rmi/RMIExample[RMI Example]

Launch it by running the `main` method in your IDE , after having build the project with `mvn clean package`, with:

----
java -jar target/camel-bridge-examples-3.3.2.jar run io.vertx.example.camel.rmi.RMIExample
